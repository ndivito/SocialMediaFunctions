Edward 40hands
Sorry, it's just, people are complaining (Too bad)
You know, they want to know if you guys can maybe try tuning up again? Or- (No!)
...play on beat and just do it right? (No!) All right
Let's stop foolin' around
And turn this band into a lean, mean
Mom Jeans revenge machine (Yeah!)
Mom Jeans!
What do you want me to say
It's never going away
'Cause I'm stuck on you
Like the smell of cigarettes on your flower dress
I want you under my fingernails
I want you in my sleep and in my dreams
I wake up spooning my pillow
Sweaty hands but please don't tell your friends
Now I'm addicted to cigarettes
At first I didn't let myself inhale
But smoke got through and so did you
And now every burn hole smells like home
And I know it's killing me
But that still won't stop me
'Cause now we smell the same
But you still kill me faster
I don't mind that you lie sometimes
Because I lie too guess I'm just like you
I don't mind that you lie sometimes
Because I lie too guess I'm just like you
I don't mind that you lie sometimes
Because I lie too guess I'm just like you
I don't mind that you lie sometimes
Because I lie too guess I'm just like you
I don't mind
That you lie sometimes
Because Iie too
Guess i'm just like you
